# International Alert Security App

The International Alert Security App allows you to log your trips and helps to ensure that you keep in touch with your preferred point of contact as an alternative to filling in the tracker. This makes it quicker and simpler to add, modify and remove trips with a clear and easy-to-use interface right from your mobile device.

## Getting Started

### Create an Account
When you first launch the Alert Security app, you will be prompted to create an account. Use your Alert email and then choose a password and click the "*Create Account*" button.

**Note:** If you have already done this and are seeing this page after reinstalling or updating the app then you can skip this step by clicking the "*Existing User*" button.

### Forgotten Password
If you have created an account but do not remember the password, then click the "*Forgot Password*" button on the *Login* page. From here, enter your Alert email and you will be sent a password reset email.

### Logging In
To log into the Alert Security app, just enter your registered Alert email and password and click the "*Login*" button. If you would like the app to remember your email so you don't have to type it next time you login, check the "*Remember Email*" box.

**Note:** It is not recommended to use this feature on shared devices.

### Logging Out
To log out of the Alert Security app, navigate to the *Home* screen and click the *Logout icon* in the top right. You will be asked to confirm this action and upon doing so, will be logged out and returned to the *Login* page.

### Adding a Trip
To add a trip, first navigate to the "*Add Trip*" page from your *Home* screen. You will then be presented with the *Add Trip* form. Enter your *leave* and *return* dates by clicking the calendar icons on the right-hand side of the screen and then select the correct date from the pop-up calendar. Then, choose your destination and preferred contact from the dropdown menus and click "*Confirm*". The app will then email you with a confirmation, as well as email your preferred contact informing them of your trip. The app will also place an event into your phone character for the duration of the trip, which will remind you to check in with your contact.

### Viewing Current Trips
To view your current trips, navigate to the "*View Current Information*" page from your *Home* screen. You will then be presented with a summary of all of your trips, organised by date order. To select a specific trip, just click on it and you will be taken to a detailed breakdown of the trip.
#### Editing a Trip
To edit a trip, click the "*Edit*" button. This will unlock the fields so that you can make any alterations to your trip, such as *Leaving* and *Return* dates, *Destination* and you can also update your chosen *Contact*. Once you have made your changes, click the "*Update*" button and your trip will be updated (The calendar event will also be updated automatically). You will then be redirected back to the *Home* screen.
#### Deleting a Trip
To delete a trip, click the "*Edit*" button. This will allow you to then click the "*Delete*" button. Upon confirmation, the trip will be removed, along with the calendar event.

### Checking In
To check in, click the "*Check In*" on the *Home* screen. You will be asked to confirm and upon doing so, the Alert Security app will automatically send an SMS message to your chosen contact.

### Triggering an SOS
To trigger an SOS, click the red "*SOS*" button on your *Home* screen. Once you have confirmed, the Alert Security app will send an emergency SMS message to your chosen contact. It will also take your GPS location and a photograph from your front-facing camera (if supported) and attach them to an email which will be sent to your chosen contact.
